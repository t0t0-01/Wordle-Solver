# Wordle-Solver
This is dedicated to Chafic, who never misses the opportunity to:
<ol>
  <li>Trash my Wordle skills</li>
  <li>Express his disappointment in me, because back in his days they used to wirte C++ code that solved world hunger in under 3 hours</li>
</ol>
So, dear kind Sir, as a fight for my dignity, here is your Wordle Solver, developed fully in-house :)
